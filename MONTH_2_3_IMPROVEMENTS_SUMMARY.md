This document summarizes the Medium Term improvements completed for the Muse Flow AI project, focusing on Architecture Refactoring, Monitoring & Analytics, AI Provider Abstraction, and Advanced Features.

## âœ… 1. Architecture Refactoring

### Architecture Issues Identified

Lack of proper abstractions and interfaces made the codebase difficult to extend and maintain.

### Architecture Solution Overview

- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations for data manipulation
- **Search Capabilities**: Built-in search functionality with filtering and sorting
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to implement for any data entity

```typescript
interface IRepository<T, K = string> {
  findById(id: K): Promise<T | null>;
  findAll(filters?: Record<string, any>): Promise<T[]>;
  create(entity: Omit<T, 'id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>): Promise<T>;
  update(id: K, updates: Partial<T>): Promise<T>;
  delete(id: K): Promise<void>;
  // ... more methods
}
```

#### Service Layer Architecture

// Performance tracking
await monitor.trackPerformance({
  name: 'api_response_time',
  value: responseTime,
  unit: 'ms',
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Event tracking
await monitor.trackEvent({
  type: 'user_action',
  userId: 'user123',
  properties: { action: 'document_save', document_id: 'doc456' }
});

// Alert configuration
monitor.addAlertRule({
  id: 'high_error_rate',
  metric: 'error_rate',
  condition: 'greater_than',
  threshold: 5,
  actions: [{ type: 'log', config: { level: 'error' } }]
});
```

  abstract getAvailableModels(): Promise<AIModel[]>;
  
  // Built-in utilities
  protected async makeRequest<T>(url: string, options: RequestInit): Promise<T>;
  protected async retryOperation<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
  protected calculateCost(tokens: number, model: string): number;
}
```
